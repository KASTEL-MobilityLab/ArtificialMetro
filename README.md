# Metro Demonstrator

**Visualizing Mobility in Karlsruhe**

Metro Demonstrator is a project at a practical course at Mobility Lab at KASTEL (KIT).

Metro Demonstrator visualizes available mobility data from multiple sources for Karlsruhe. It aims to demonstrate what data is already available, as well as showcase which confidential information can be derived from this data. Of course, Metro Demonstrator is also good for entertaining people at Mobility Lab.
