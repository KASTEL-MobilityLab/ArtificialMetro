Usage
=====

Start Metro Demonstrator by executing `npm run prod` or `npx tsx server.ts` The server listens on `http://localhost:3000`.

You can navigate the different views by clicking on the view switcher on the lower left corner or by pressing the keys `1 - 9`. By default, Metro Demonstrator will switch views periodically. This is deactivated when you switch to a view manually. You can toggle automatic switching with the leftmost button or with the `0` key.

Map views may display a preset switcher on the upper left corner. You can switch between map presets by clicking on the preset switcher or by repeatedly pressing the key associated with the current view.
